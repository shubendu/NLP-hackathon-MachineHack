especially the tender growth during the spring, difficult to fill up the bird bath, etc.  you really need the distinct spray patterns if you're a gardener (or weed picker which i really am).-trigger:  i purchased this one for this reason alone.  even though it's not marketed as being for anyone that wants an easier trigger or for those w/arthritis, this nozzle  has the best trigger i've ever felt. easy, smooth and solid. you won't ever have to exert undue pressure to press the trigger or adjust the rotary dial-love the rubber coating: it's nicer than the all metal ones. every component of this nozzle exemplifies this - it has heft, each component seems to work/adjust so smoothly but firmly.  one parting advice is if you do use a garden hose frequently, it's worth it to go down to your local hardware or garden supply store and test them.  i like ordering online for many things but there is so much variability w/these nozzles.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,gone way many garden nozzles probably read many articles best hose nozzle list not appear find simply best learned not like wand nozzles angle never seems right except tall tomato plants heavy newly popular firemen nozzles challenging use w lever seems great concept execution annoying nozzles solid hefty feel without heavy best lot spray adjustment dial best easy adjust different pattern not loose heavy move feels solid smoothly slips whatever spray pattern designate spray adjustment possibility thought would love adjustable spray nozzles turn since learned not specific enough job want w exception jet spray pattern impossible spray garden vegetables especially tender growth spring difficult fill bird bath etc really need distinct spray patterns gardener weed picker really trigger purchased one reason alone even though not marketed anyone wants easier trigger w arthritis nozzle best trigger ever felt easy smooth solid not ever exert undue pressure press trigger adjust rotary dial love rubber coating nicer metal ones every component nozzle exemplifies heft component seems work adjust smoothly firmly one parting advice use garden hose frequently worth go local hardware garden supply store test like ordering online many things much variability w nozzles,"['gone', 'way', 'many', 'garden', 'nozzles', 'probably', 'read', 'many', 'articles', 'best', 'hose', 'nozzle', 'list', 'not', 'appear', 'find', 'simply', 'best', 'learned', 'not', 'like', 'wand', 'nozzles', 'angle', 'never', 'seems', 'right', 'except', 'tall', 'tomato', 'plants', 'heavy', 'newly', 'popular', 'firemen', 'nozzles', 'challenging', 'use', 'w', 'lever', 'seems', 'great', 'concept', 'execution', 'annoying', 'nozzles', 'solid', 'hefty', 'feel', 'without', 'heavy', 'best', 'lot', 'spray', 'adjustment', 'dial', 'best', 'easy', 'adjust', 'different', 'pattern', 'not', 'loose', 'heavy', 'move', 'feels', 'solid', 'smoothly', 'slips', 'whatever', 'spray', 'pattern', 'designate', 'spray', 'adjustment', 'possibility', 'thought', 'would', 'love', 'adjustable', 'spray', 'nozzles', 'turn', 'since', 'learned', 'not', 'specific', 'enough', 'job', 'want', 'w', 'exception', 'jet', 'spray', 'pattern', 'impossible', 'spray', 'garden', 'vegetables', 'especially', 'tender', 'growth', 'spring', 'difficult', 'fill', 'bird', 'bath', 'etc', 'really', 'need', 'distinct', 'spray', 'patterns', 'gardener', 'weed', 'picker', 'really', 'trigger', 'purchased', 'one', 'reason', 'alone', 'even', 'though', 'not', 'marketed', 'anyone', 'wants', 'easier', 'trigger', 'w', 'arthritis', 'nozzle', 'best', 'trigger', 'ever', 'felt', 'easy', 'smooth', 'solid', 'not', 'ever', 'exert', 'undue', 'pressure', 'press', 'trigger', 'adjust', 'rotary', 'dial', 'love', 'rubber', 'coating', 'nicer', 'metal', 'ones', 'every', 'component', 'nozzle', 'exemplifies', 'heft', 'component', 'seems', 'work', 'adjust', 'smoothly', 'firmly', 'one', 'parting', 'advice', 'use', 'garden', 'hose', 'frequently', 'worth', 'go', 'local', 'hardware', 'garden', 'supply', 'store', 'test', 'like', 'ordering', 'online', 'many', 'things', 'much', 'variability', 'w', 'nozzles']"

my suggestion is poe(power over ethernet) camera system with an nvr(network video recorder) which contains a hard drive where video is stored locally at your house. there are plenty of these type systems for all budgets, a simple google search will get you started. if you can operate a drill and a screwdriver you can install this type of system or you can purchase it and pay a professional service. the main point is get your footage locally stored where you are in charge of it not the ""cloud"" and not to rely on wifi connectivity...no wifi no video storage, that's pretty useless...!",0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,motion detection great phone constantly giving motion notifications annoying app not customizable enough either get constant notifications hardly night vision okwifi absolutely horrible hardwired outdoor cameras ring doorbell pro chime wifi extender high end wifi router constantly losing signal cameras walk across street neighbors garage still wifi phone tablet not wifi router signal even though reconnect option app not work way reconnect physically push reset button camera enter set mode push exit setup reconnect option app not reconnect beyond not home able physically go affected camera push reset not reconnect get home pretty useless vacation unable manually reset camera no local storage options not subscribe ring plan cameras good real time viewing vehicle burglarized night not ring plan no footage review selling ring cams going another brand local storage option keeping footage house control suggestion poe power ethernet camera system nvr network video recorder contains hard drive video stored locally house plenty type systems budgets simple google search get started operate drill screwdriver install type system purchase pay professional service main point get footage locally stored charge not cloud not rely wifi connectivity no wifi no video storage pretty useless,"['motion', 'detection', 'great', 'phone', 'constantly', 'giving', 'motion', 'notifications', 'annoying', 'app', 'not', 'customizable', 'enough', 'either', 'get', 'constant', 'notifications', 'hardly', 'night', 'vision', 'okwifi', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'hardwired', 'outdoor', 'cameras', 'ring', 'doorbell', 'pro', 'chime', 'wifi', 'extender', 'high', 'end', 'wifi', 'router', 'constantly', 'losing', 'signal', 'cameras', 'walk', 'across', 'street', 'neighbors', 'garage', 'still', 'wifi', 'phone', 'tablet', 'not', 'wifi', 'router', 'signal', 'even', 'though', 'reconnect', 'option', 'app', 'not', 'work', 'way', 'reconnect', 'physically', 'push', 'reset', 'button', 'camera', 'enter', 'set', 'mode', 'push', 'exit', 'setup', 'reconnect', 'option', 'app', 'not', 'reconnect', 'beyond', 'not', 'home', 'able', 'physically', 'go', 'affected', 'camera', 'push', 'reset', 'not', 'reconnect', 'get', 'home', 'pretty', 'useless', 'vacation', 'unable', 'manually', 'reset', 'camera', 'no', 'local', 'storage', 'options', 'not', 'subscribe', 'ring', 'plan', 'cameras', 'good', 'real', 'time', 'viewing', 'vehicle', 'burglarized', 'night', 'not', 'ring', 'plan', 'no', 'footage', 'review', 'selling', 'ring', 'cams', 'going', 'another', 'brand', 'local', 'storage', 'option', 'keeping', 'footage', 'house', 'control', 'suggestion', 'poe', 'power', 'ethernet', 'camera', 'system', 'nvr', 'network', 'video', 'recorder', 'contains', 'hard', 'drive', 'video', 'stored', 'locally', 'house', 'plenty', 'type', 'systems', 'budgets', 'simple', 'google', 'search', 'get', 'started', 'operate', 'drill', 'screwdriver', 'install', 'type', 'system', 'purchase', 'pay', 'professional', 'service', 'main', 'point', 'get', 'footage', 'locally', 'stored', 'charge', 'not', 'cloud', 'not', 'rely', 'wifi', 'connectivity', 'no', 'wifi', 'no', 'video', 'storage', 'pretty', 'useless']"
