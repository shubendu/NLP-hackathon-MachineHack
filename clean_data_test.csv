42,"Great easy to use app, add new devices by simply scanning a QRC code. Sets up in a couple of minutes. Nice customizable control settings for motion detection zones, lights, video, & notifications. You can link devices so if one device detects motion other devices will start recording. Linking chimes are easy the app even gives you device health status. Easy to snooze motion if you are working outside. You can manually turn on the lights and a siren too if you like. Easy to replay and save videos. I like the people only motion sensitivity mode but not the color night vision. It makes the video look odd with the colors added.1. The installation is easy and instructions are accurate. Well thought out, except for one glaring omission. I would bet most people who buy the Wired camera drill a hole through the house and plug it in at the garage door opener outlet. The problem is that the plug is Giant and Nobody wants to drill a Giant hole (probably at least 11/4 "") in their wall to pull the plug through for a small cable. Ring should be able to figure this out themselves, maybe with a quick connect/disconnect on the cord near the plug? You really need to practice installing these in real world situations Ring.I was able to figure this out myself by removing 4 small screws from the light base and pull off the cover. There you see the +/- power leads and remove the 2 really small screws holding them down. Remove the 2 really tiny screws that holds a small metal bracket that attaches the cable to the base and pull the cable out. From here you only need to drill a 1/2"" to 5/8"" max hole through your house. Slide the cable through the wall then reassemble in reverse order without losing any of the tiny screws.2. When I went to register my new device for the free 30 day trial their system put my existing device on the trial ( I have the one year paid subscription on that one) and showed the new device not on any trial or plan. I chatted with Ring twice about the issue and they agreed that their system didn't work correctly, but they could never resolve the issue.

Finally i shot an email off to the manufacturer telling them I give up and would they tell me the trick. I got a reply almost immediately. Apparently nobody can get them open, and everybody ends up calling or emailing this guy.You'll need a screwdriver and some electrical tape.

62,Heavy Duty is a great descriptor for this sprinkler. It's mostly made of metal. There's some plastic in the gearing section and that water tight area that will suffer but the rest is made of metal. The base is cast and the sprinkler arm is an extrusion. The water jets are brass. This is all really nice for longevity.I like the adjustments and find this sprinkler works just as well as the old plastic one it replaces only it's definitely more adjustable. I try to isolate the areas that I cover with varying water pressure at the spigot but this Expert Gardner lets you make that adjustment right on the housing.See more,,,,,,,,,,,,,heavy duty great descriptor sprinkler mostly made metal plastic gearing section water tight area suffer rest made metal base cast sprinkler arm extrusion water jets brass really nice longevity like adjustments find sprinkler works well old plastic one replaces definitely adjustable try isolate areas cover varying water pressure spigot expert gardner lets make adjustment right housing see

Prior to buying, I specifically asked Ring Tech Support if these cameras would be damaged by our Arizona UV and was assured this would not be a problem.2. Ring apparently uses polymer lenses in their cameras intended for exterior use. I find this unacceptable, especially give my experience at 3 1/2yrs in. See pictures.

However, several Youtube videos later and trial and error were required to figure out how to compress the rubber washers (?) enough for the bolt to be long enough to go through them into the holes in the tank and attach the tank to the bowl.

162,"Purchased 2 of the Cimarrons to replace the 30 yr old toilets as part of a remodeling project. They were installed by a plumber and required some shiming to eliminate the wobble from the tile flooring. Operationally, I'm disappointed in the flush performance- these toilets require you to hold down the handle for 4-5 seconds in order for the tank to empty. Unlike the old flapper style, this ""cannister"" design drops and shuts off the water flow as soon as you release the handle. It's going to be embarrassing having to explain to guests how to operate the toilet correctly. Also, as noted in other reviews, the black hose that runs from the valve to the cannister needs to be shortened an inch or so, or the hose will kink and prevent water from filling the bowl after flushing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,purchased cimarrons replace yr old toilets part remodeling project installed plumber required shiming eliminate wobble tile flooring operationally disappointed flush performance toilets require hold handle seconds order tank empty unlike old flapper style cannister design drops shuts water flow soon release handle going embarrassing explain guests operate toilet correctly also noted reviews black hose runs valve cannister needs shortened inch hose kink prevent water filling bowl flushing

Every time we flush, it makes a loud 'Bang' sound.  We have been in contact with tech support from Ove, and per their suggestions, we have tried to reset the system, replace the solenoid.  We also tried difference connections: we first started with Ove shut-off value without water hammer arrester, then we installed the water hammer arrester, that didn't help, then we tried with the 3/8 shut-off valve connection.  But none of the above works.  (Please note: Ove didn't have any field technicians to help us to replace any parts or connect the toilet with difference methods.  All the works were done by a plumber, hired by us!)  Now, they are saying our water pipe need to strap down, well, that is easy, just knock a few walls and tight it down.  Even if we are willing to go that far, there is no guarantee that it will work.  We have disk washer machine, washer machine for cloth etc.â€¦ all work nicely and QUIETLY. So, I believe there is a defect in their design.  The 2 years warranty from Ove only go as far as sending us parts, we still need to pay someone to do the work, and there is limited number of parts they can send us, they won't give us a replacement or credit toward another product. so at the end of day, we got a $1200+ toilet sitting there for the look, and if we need some attention, we hit the flush button, and it will go 'bang', 'bang', 'bang'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,lena smart toilet since oct good looking felt bought look not comfortable using anymore every time flush makes loud bang sound contact tech support ove per suggestions tried reset system replace solenoid also tried difference connections first started ove shut value without water hammer arrester installed water hammer arrester not help tried shut valve connection none works please note ove not field technicians help us replace parts connect toilet difference methods works done plumber hired us saying water pipe need strap well easy knock walls tight even willing go far no guarantee work disk washer machine washer machine cloth etc work nicely quietly believe defect design years warranty ove go far sending us parts still need pay someone work limited number parts send us not give us replacement credit toward another product end day got toilet sitting look need attention hit flush button go bang bang bang

427,"I received this item to evaluate and I was happy to accept it. I have always thought very highly of Rain Bird products and have used them for many years. They make the best sprinkler heads I've ever owned. That being said, I'm going to be a bit critical.This item is an in-ground sprinkler with a quick disconnect for your garden hose. It is designed to be mounted flush with the surface and uses an impulse sprinkler which can be adjusted for both distance and circumference. The sprinkler head itself measures about 4"" across at the cap in depth into the ground is 9"". The second part is a bit wider (5"") and mounts about 8 in. away from the sprinkler head itself. It's only 5"" tall but you will still have to dig down 9"" to make room for the hose adapter. The lid locks in place so you don't have to worry about it coming loose with from a lawnmower even a good one that has good vacuum power. The instructions state this can water up to 41 feet across in a full circle. This measurement depends on your water pressure and can vary by a few feet. Normal water pressure is generally between 40 and 60 PSI and my house runs at the higher end at 60-65 PSI this really covers a large area for me. As with any impulse style sprinkler head the distance can be adjusted at the front and the circumference can be adjusted anywhere from 0 to 360Â°. You will have to adjusted with the water on because this unit has a pretty beefy spring that holds a down. As you can see by one of the pictures, I'm using a bamboo stick to hold it in place so I can take a picture the sprinkler head and the stick is being bent from the spring tension. There is a lot of positive things to say about this model because it was built very well but I don't feel this would be of use for the average homeowner, unless they had a small yard or area needing watered. The reason I say this is because this is basically a sprinkler that you can never move around. It sprays in a circle, or half circle, or quarter circle (whatever you want) but it only does one area and wherever you bury it is where it stays. Plus, the colder northern areas where the ground freezes down a foot or more this thing could freeze as you blow it out like with a typical in-ground sprinkler system. That being said, this is one heavy duty sprinkler head and can easily be adapted to a regular sprinkler system as the input is threaded for generic adapters.So, I gave this four stars. Five stars for the Rain Bird quality that I've known for years and only three stars as this is not very practical for a typical homeowner as most homes do not have a just a single dedicated area for something like this. Since you still have to drag the hose out and put the adapter on, why not just get a regular impulse sprinkler that you can use everywhere in your yard?I will be adding this to my in-ground sprinkler system on its own zone since I have a large area of landscaping where this would work great. But if I had a choice of using one that would be permanently installed and I would have to hook a garden hose to every time, or just use a regular lawn sprinkler that I could use anywhere in my yard I would choose the latter. Rain Bird should sell these sprinkler heads separately because I really like these to use in an in-ground system.I would recommend it to a friend, but only if I knew they had an area where this would come in handy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,received item evaluate happy accept always thought highly rain bird products used many years make best sprinkler heads ever owned said going bit critical item ground sprinkler quick disconnect garden hose designed mounted flush surface uses impulse sprinkler adjusted distance circumference sprinkler head measures across cap depth ground second part bit wider mounts away sprinkler head tall still dig make room hose adapter lid locks place not worry coming loose lawnmower even good one good vacuum power instructions state water feet across full circle measurement depends water pressure vary feet normal water pressure generally psi house runs higher end psi really covers large area impulse style sprinkler head distance adjusted front circumference adjusted anywhere adjusted water unit pretty beefy spring holds see one pictures using bamboo stick hold place take picture sprinkler head stick bent spring tension lot positive things say model built well not feel would use average homeowner unless small yard area needing watered reason say basically sprinkler never move around sprays circle half circle quarter circle whatever want one area wherever bury stays plus colder northern areas ground freezes foot thing could freeze blow like typical ground sprinkler system said one heavy duty sprinkler head easily adapted regular sprinkler system input threaded generic adapters gave four stars five stars rain bird quality known years three stars not practical typical homeowner homes not single dedicated area something like since still drag hose put adapter not get regular impulse sprinkler use everywhere yard adding ground sprinkler system zone since large area landscaping would work great choice using one would permanently installed would hook garden hose every time use regular lawn sprinkler could use anywhere yard would choose latter rain bird sell sprinkler heads separately really like use ground system would recommend friend knew area would come handy

Ran out to the garbage to get the washer off the old toilet before trash was picked up or I'd be without a toilet.  I've been on the phone for for an hour and a half for them to send me a washer and I am still waiting in the queue.  A $250 toilet should have better QA then for someone to miss installing a 50 cent rubber washer at the factory.

I was able to get the width to fit the chairs OK, but the cushion's seat extends beyond the chair edge - it wasn't too bad to adjust to this feature. The depth is super plush and comfortable! Because the chairs' back is rounded the pillows are fine.

682,The springs are not super strong. I have a pair of clamps that are so strong I can almost not open them up. These have about the pressure you'd expect for the size. The way the body of the clamp is formed there's a hollow area underneath the pad where you hold objects. If you are clamping some thin wood while the glue sets up you would most likely need to use calls under the clamp so that the hollow area didn't affect your gluing surface. The problems I have with these clams may just be due to unfamiliarity. All my other clamps like this are plastic. The two sides can be off as much as 3/16 to a quarter of an inch. Most likely that wouldn't cause a problem I was just surprised how sloppy they were side to side.,,,,,,,,,,,,,springs not super strong pair clamps strong almost not open pressure would expect size way body clamp formed hollow area underneath pad hold objects clamping thin wood glue sets would likely need use calls clamp hollow area not affect gluing surface problems clams may due unfamiliarity clamps like plastic two sides much quarter inch likely would not cause problem surprised sloppy side side

704,"The project intended for this item was an outdoor shower. However several of the parts needed for completion were back ordered and will not be received for 2-3 weeks and I didn't want to wait to write the review. The water line is of Â¾ inch PEX tubing (picture 1) and I was amazed at how easily it cut with the Kobalt cutter. The cut ends are clean and there is no deviation in the tubing, which makes inserting fittings much easier. In picture number 2 you can see the difference between the ""Factory cut"" and the Kobalt cut, with the factory cut on the right and showing that the Kobalt cut is even cleaner. The cutter fits well in your grip and it cuts effortlessly through the tubing, which means less fatigue during large projects. The blades are easily removed and replaced (pictures 3 & 4) and replacements are available at Lowes (part #2146990). While using the cutter I found it is also useful in the installation of irrigation tubing, which I use in our flower beds and garden. It easily and cleanly cuts the Â¼ inch drip tubing, which I have previously cut with diagonal pliers and which tends to squash the tube and make it difficult to attach to fittings or multi distribution ports. I understand the Kobalt cutter can also be used to cut Poly Pipe, since I haven't used it in that capacity, I can only assume it will perform the same with that material. With the Kobalt cutter the cut is clean with minimal deviation, which makes the job go much easier and quickly.

Even though the old box was nailed to the joist, I was able to cut the old nails off through the 4"" hole with a oscillating saw to remove the old box. The joists are on 16"" centers. I placed and tightened the remodel hanger and even though the old box was tight to the joist and the drywall was partially cut over the joist for the 4 "" hole, this hanger let me install a fan now supported on both sides.

1282,"Thought I would spend extra money on a sprinkler for a metal one that would last longer than the plastic ones that never last a season.  My mistake.  First of all, only the frame is metal (not really sure what kind of metal it is - some type of pot metal, magnets don't stick to it), the underside, where the water is piped in, is all plastic. There is a metal coupling that your hose threads into has a thin plastic/rubber ring around it that is supposed to make tightening the coupling to the hose easier.  Except it doesn't.  The plastic ring is just loose around the coupling and within the first day of use immediately was abraded enough on the inner part to make it unusable.  In fact, it made it *more* difficult to tighten or loosen since it just spins around the metal coupling.  Pull that off thinking you can tighten by hand is a mistake also as the outer part of the coupling is closer to jagged serrations than actual an nut head.  Wait! If that is not enough, the coupling does not fit tightly against the inner part of the tubing that goes to the sprinkler, so of course it leaks like a sieve!  Yes I have replaced the inner washers with brand new ones and it made no difference.  Save your money and look elsewhere.  It is simply amazing what companies sell anymore.  The days of quality and value are long gone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,thought would spend extra money sprinkler metal one would last longer plastic ones never last season mistake first frame metal not really sure kind metal type pot metal magnets not stick underside water piped plastic metal coupling hose threads thin plastic rubber ring around supposed make tightening coupling hose easier except not plastic ring loose around coupling within first day use immediately abraded enough inner part make unusable fact made difficult tighten loosen since spins around metal coupling pull thinking tighten hand mistake also outer part coupling closer jagged serrations actual nut head wait not enough coupling not fit tightly inner part tubing goes sprinkler course leaks like sieve yes replaced inner washers brand new ones made no difference save money look elsewhere simply amazing companies sell anymore days quality value long gone

A plumber's snake was required to get it flowing again. The box boasted it has more efficient flushing power. However, compared to our American Standard toilet in our other bathroom, the flushing performance is disappointing. It didn't seem much more efficient than the old toilet it replaced. Reviewing a video made by the manufacturer and examining the inner workings showed me why. I suggest buyers interested in this or any other new toilets do their research especially if flushing performance is important.

1751,"I've owned 4 of these toilets to date. The first two worked flawlessly with a super easy install and great rebate offered by local water company. The last two have been nothing but trouble. The tank itself bubbles (NOT the bowl), right by the black enclosure which surrounds the flush valve. After calling Niagara and speaking with 4 different humans and 1 human manager, multiple times, I have been told to continue waiting while an engineer ""researches"" the problem/solution. I have been awaiting a call back with their findings for over 2 weeks, even after I asked for updates along the way. Unfortunately, a bubbling sound is very bothersome and annoying and apparently it's par for the course according to the human manager over at Niagara. He assured me it is just part of the package deal, which is weird because neither of my two previous Niagara toilets had this issue nor could I find another issue mentioned online anywhere. To this date, Niagara has all but given up on providing mediocre customer service to the customers with any sort of real issue. Their default response is to offer a replacement part before they even understand the symptoms. The greatest part about good ole Troy's response over there at Niagara is that the engineer doesn't need to know what I've tried or adjusted or controlled for in all my tinkering with the toilet over the last month. I'm just curious, is there actually some engineer trying to better understand the bubbling in the tank or is the whole idea a waiting game for me to give up, because that's how it feels. I'm disappointed in their lack of honesty and ability to meet customer's needs when it's not just an easy fix, and for that I give the toilet a 1 star rating because it makes a terrible noise every time I flush.",,,,,,,,,,,,,owned toilets date first two worked flawlessly super easy install great rebate offered local water company last two nothing trouble tank bubbles not bowl right black enclosure surrounds flush valve calling niagara speaking different humans human manager multiple times told continue waiting engineer researches problem solution awaiting call back findings weeks even asked updates along way unfortunately bubbling sound bothersome annoying apparently par course according human manager niagara assured part package deal weird neither two previous niagara toilets issue nor could find another issue mentioned online anywhere date niagara given providing mediocre customer service customers sort real issue default response offer replacement part even understand symptoms greatest part good ole troy response niagara engineer not need know tried adjusted controlled tinkering toilet last month curious actually engineer trying better understand bubbling tank whole idea waiting game give feels disappointed lack honesty ability meet customer needs not easy fix give toilet star rating makes terrible noise every time flush

1754,"I already own the Ring Doorbell Pro but the way my garage is recessed on the driveway, the doorbell cam cannot see where I park my car at night. We have had recent occurrences of people checking car doors at night so this camera made sense for safety and security and the light (and sensor) is a good deterrent when it turns on.I mounted this cam above the garage door at an angle that has a full view of my car and all the way across the street. The wide angle lens is excellent and shows a lot of real estate. I chose the wired version since I have an outlet within the distance of the provided power wire (very long) and simply drilled a hole at the spot and ran the cord through the wall (See pictures). The kit comes with wire clamps that can be nailed in every 3 feet or so and it makes it look like a professional install. I then plugged it into the outlet on the ceiling where the garage door opener plugs in.It has a lot of features but here are my favorites.- No direct wiring. Simply plug it in a configure. (They sell direct wire and even battery versions as well)- The spotlight sensitivity and area detection are both adjustable so I can set it to only turn on the light when you are half way up the driveway. However, it will start recording when a person is walking on the sidewalk on my side of the street or even across the street.- I set it so it will only record when a person is detected. It will not record when a car drives by. It can be set either this was just a personal preference.- The light intensity is adjustable as well. I have it set to Max and it is blinding.- The night vision is excellent.- Two really cool features: - I can click a button in the smartphone app and speak to my phone and the audio comes out of the camera speaker allowing you to talk to some on the driveway. The microphone on the camera allows the person to talk back. During a recording session the camera records audio. Crystal clear audio even 60 or more feet away. Some neighborhood kids were arguing about cleaning up dog poop on my lawn the other day and I could hear every word and that was 60 feet away. (They cleaned it up) - There is also a button on the app to turn on an audible alarm. The motion sensor will flash red when you do this.- The install is extremely easy and even with drilling that hole took a total of 15 minutes.A lot more can be configured but these are the main items that I use.The reason I gave it four instead of five stars is the zoom functionality. When you zoom in it gets more and more pixelated as you get closer. I do have friends that have other brands and admittedly they do the same thing. Hopefully this gets better in the future.All in all I really like the security they provide. I can wake up in the morning and see all the activity that occurred at night to ensure that nobody was near my house, or I can be alerted in real time during the night if there is activity.5 Stars for ease of install5 Stars for quality and features4 Stars for Zoom in picture quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,already ring doorbell pro way garage recessed driveway doorbell cam cannot see park car night recent occurrences people checking car doors night camera made sense safety security light sensor good deterrent turns mounted cam garage door angle full view car way across street wide angle lens excellent shows lot real estate chose wired version since outlet within distance provided power wire long simply drilled hole spot ran cord wall see pictures kit comes wire clamps nailed every feet makes look like professional install plugged outlet ceiling garage door opener plugs lot features favorites no direct wiring simply plug configure sell direct wire even battery versions well spotlight sensitivity area detection adjustable set turn light half way driveway however start recording person walking sidewalk side street even across street set record person detected not record car drives set either personal preference light intensity adjustable well set max blinding night vision excellent two really cool features click button smartphone app speak phone audio comes camera speaker allowing talk driveway microphone camera allows person talk back recording session camera records audio crystal clear audio even feet away neighborhood kids arguing cleaning dog poop lawn day could hear every word feet away cleaned also button app turn audible alarm motion sensor flash red install extremely easy even drilling hole took total minutes lot configured main items use reason gave four instead five stars zoom functionality zoom gets pixelated get closer friends brands admittedly thing hopefully gets better future really like security provide wake morning see activity occurred night ensure nobody near house alerted real time night stars ease stars quality stars zoom picture quality

As I mentioned, we were replacing an older outlet that was a standard outlet within 2 feet of a baptistry pool. It was very easy to change out the outlet that this cover came with to a GFCI outlet to make it safer for floor use.The only downside I had was because both the outlet box and the cover need to fit into the hole, there is almost no play on the measurements if you are off.

1828,"The Expert Gardener Industrial Nozzle, is a great basic sprayer to connect to your garden hose. It is made of hard plastic, and feels very solid. I have already dropped it on the concrete, and not a scratch on it, after it bounced around. The parts that connect to the hoses are metal, which makes them even more durable. The sprayer design allows you to decide what type of spray to use, by just squeezing the lever differently, from a very light fan type of spray for watering delicate flowers, to a powerful spray, that shoots about 25 feet, for things like washing your car. The grip has a notch for your index finger, which helps it stay in your hand, even when wet. There is also a metal flip piece, that allows you to set the spray level, and not have to continuously squeeze the handle to keep it spraying. The other cool design thing, is the screw piece on the end of the nozzle, so you can attach another hose to it, or attach those weed and feed spray attachments to it, to give more power and control over the water flow, when using those types of things. If you are looking for a basic sprayer, but want a few extra bells and whistles, I highly recommend the Expert Gardener Industrial Nozzle.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,,expert gardener industrial nozzle great basic sprayer connect garden hose made hard plastic feels solid already dropped concrete not scratch bounced around parts connect hoses metal makes even durable sprayer design allows decide type spray use squeezing lever differently light fan type spray watering delicate flowers powerful spray shoots feet things like washing car grip notch index finger helps stay hand even wet also metal flip piece allows set spray level not continuously squeeze handle keep spraying cool design thing screw piece end nozzle attach another hose attach weed feed spray attachments give power control water flow using types things looking basic sprayer want extra bells whistles highly recommend expert gardener industrial nozzle see

This nozzle is a smaller sized nozzle than I had expected and it seems to be a lighter weight metal, which I'm afraid won't last past one summer. This nozzle would be appropriate for gardening and yard use for sure. The water stream can be adjusted by using the gold colored screw on the back side of the nozzle. Even though you can adjust it, it's really not really accurate on the adjusting part. You can shoot a full powered stream of water or make it a spread out shower pattern but that's about it. This nozzle is good when you clean out horse trailers or when you wash pickups and it works good to spray the under side of a muddy pickup too. These are handy tools to have around the yard during the summer for sure.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,,review expert gardener metal pistol nozzle nozzle smaller sized nozzle expected seems lighter weight metal afraid not last past one summer nozzle would appropriate gardening yard use sure water stream adjusted using gold colored screw back side nozzle even though adjust really not really accurate adjusting part shoot full powered stream water make spread shower pattern nozzle good clean horse trailers wash pickups works good spray side muddy pickup handy tools around yard summer sure see

2177,"The Expert Gardener brand telescoping wand is the perfect accessory to have if you wash your vehicle yourself instead of going to a car wash, which is the primary reason I got it. The main advantages to using this wand when washing a car is the ability to control the water flow to a very very low rate, along with an adjustable water pattern spray. When rinsing the car with the very low water flow spray, with the pattern set to a wide setting, it really helps to prevent water spots on the car as compared to using a regular water hose with sprayer attachment. The telescoping action of the wand also allows you to direct the rinse water where you want it to go on top of the car without straining to reach those areas.In my experience, and this is with the hard water in Phoenix AZ, the water spots are almost eliminated on the vertical areas (the sides, the doors, etc) of the car after rinsing. Horizontal areas such as the hood and the top still need some towel drying though (I think you would need a mineral free water to help with that).The adjustable water flow is easily controlled with your thumb on the handle area of the wand. From zero flow to full pressure flow. Its a lever that is moved instead of a squeeze type control, so you can set it and not have to constantly hold it to maintain a desired pressure/flow. The wand length extends from about 27 inches, to a fully extended length of 42 inches. And the spray head at the end pivots, so you can have a rain like spray over an area from a distance.There are 10 spray patterns that can be selected, by turning the dial that is around the spray head. FLAT (which is my preference for low flow final rinse when washing my car), CENTER, JET, MIST, FAN, ANGLE, SHOWER, VERTICAL, FULL, and CONE.See more",,,,,,,,,,,,,expert gardener brand telescoping wand perfect accessory wash vehicle instead going car wash primary reason got main advantages using wand washing car ability control water flow low rate along adjustable water pattern spray rinsing car low water flow spray pattern set wide setting really helps prevent water spots car compared using regular water hose sprayer attachment telescoping action wand also allows direct rinse water want go top car without straining reach areas experience hard water phoenix az water spots almost eliminated vertical areas sides doors etc car rinsing horizontal areas hood top still need towel drying though think would need mineral free water help adjustable water flow easily controlled thumb handle area wand zero flow full pressure flow lever moved instead squeeze type control set not constantly hold maintain desired pressure flow wand length extends inches fully extended length inches spray head end pivots rain like spray area distance spray patterns selected turning dial around spray head flat preference low flow final rinse washing car center jet mist fan angle shower vertical full cone see

2296,"This is probably as good a plier type pex cutting tool as you going to findâ€”very sturdy (all metal) and well made. That said, it suffers from the same deficiency that all of these tool designs doâ€”it takes some degree of skill to achieve a perfect right angle cut when it should not have to. Firstly, when you lay the pex run atop the cradle or bottom jaw of the tool, you are placing it on a smooth open sweeping surface that really offers no buttressing or guide positioning. So you must hold the length of pex perfectly still at a precise right angle against the cradle surface. Secondly, as you squeeze the handles and the blade begins to bite down on top of the tubing, the tool begins to try to pull the pex at an oblique angle, potentially jeopardizing the integrity of the cut. After a few practice tries, I was able to achieve a fairly decent square cutâ€”not perfect, but close. This tool could greatly be improved with the addition of some type of half pipe channel guideâ€”perhaps an inch or so long that was the same as the O.D. of the pex and attached to either side of the bottom jaw at right angles. That way, you could feed the tubing into the channel where it would be held in place. When you then squeezed the jaws, the tubing would be held fast, and would have no ability to wiggle or shift position, thereby yielding a perfect and precise right angle cut every time with no possibility of error. This, in my opinion would be a tremendous improvement to this type of tool with minimal redesigning.
